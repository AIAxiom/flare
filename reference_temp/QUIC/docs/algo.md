# QUIC Protocol Algorithms

## **1. Packet Parsing Algorithm**
1. Receive raw UDP packet.
2. Extract and validate QUIC packet header.
3. Identify packet type (Initial, Handshake, Short Header, etc.).
4. Parse payload based on packet type.
5. Validate cryptographic integrity.
6. Pass parsed data to connection handler.

## **2. Handshake & Key Exchange Algorithm**
1. Receive QUIC **Initial** packet from client.
2. Generate **TLS 1.3 Hello Retry Request** if needed.
3. Complete **TLS handshake** and derive cryptographic keys.
4. Encrypt/decrypt further packets using negotiated keys.
5. Establish connection state once handshake is completed.

## **3. Stream Multiplexing Algorithm**
1. Assign unique **stream IDs** for incoming/outgoing streams.
2. Maintain **flow control windows** for each stream.
3. Prioritize streams based on application logic.
4. Fragment and reassemble QUIC frames within streams.
5. Transmit and receive data while ensuring proper sequencing.

## **4. Flow Control Algorithm**
1. Maintain **receive window** and **send window** limits.
2. Adjust window size based on received acknowledgment.
3. Prevent buffer overflow by pausing/resuming streams dynamically.
4. Implement **connection-level and stream-level flow control**.

## **5. Congestion Control Algorithm**
1. Use **slow start** phase to probe network capacity.
2. Adjust congestion window size based on packet loss or delay.
3. Implement **Reno or Cubic** congestion control mechanisms.
4. Use **ACK feedback** to determine network conditions.
5. Reduce retransmission rate on packet loss.

## **6. Loss Detection & Recovery Algorithm**
1. Maintain **packet number space** for sent packets.
2. Detect missing packets via **ACK delay threshold**.
3. Retransmit lost packets after timeout.
4. Use **Packet Threshold & Time Threshold** loss detection.
5. Implement **ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification)** when available.

## **7. Timeout & Retransmission Algorithm**
1. Start timer upon sending a packet.
2. Reset timer when an ACK is received.
3. Retransmit if timeout expires.
4. Double timeout on consecutive failures.
5. Drop connection after exceeding max retries.

## **Conclusion**
These algorithms form the core of our **QUIC protocol implementation**. They ensure efficient, secure, and reliable data transmission over UDP. Further optimizations and refinements can improve performance and resilience.
