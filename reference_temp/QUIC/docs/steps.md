# Steps Followed to Implement QUIC Protocol

## **Phase 1: Basic QUIC Server Setup**
1. Set up a **UDP socket-based server** to handle QUIC communication.
2. Implemented **basic packet reception and parsing**.
3. Designed an initial **packet structure and header parsing** logic.
4. Created a **basic response mechanism** for incoming packets.

## **Phase 2: Handshake & Security**
1. Integrated **TLS 1.3 for QUIC handshake**.
2. Established **initial cryptographic key exchange**.
3. Implemented **session resumption & 0-RTT support**.
4. Designed **secure key management** and periodic key updates.

## **Phase 3: Packet Handling & Multiplexing**
1. Developed **detailed packet parsing & validation**.
2. Implemented **stream multiplexing**, allowing multiple streams over a single connection.
3. Introduced **flow control** mechanisms to manage data transfer efficiently.
4. Improved **stream prioritization** to optimize data transmission.

## **Phase 4: Connection Recovery & Error Handling**
1. Implemented **timeouts & retransmissions** for better connection reliability.
2. Designed an **error handling and logging system**.
3. Integrated **loss detection and congestion control**.
4. Optimized **connection recovery strategies** for interrupted sessions.

## **Future Enhancements & Next Steps**
- Implement **client-side QUIC support**.
- Introduce **QUIC migration handling** for changing network conditions.
- Optimize **performance, congestion control, and security hardening**.
- Expand support for **HTTP/3 and other application-layer integrations**.

## **Conclusion**
Following these structured steps, we have developed a robust, **RFC 9000-compliant QUIC server** in Python. The next phases involve **client-side implementation, optimizations, and integration with higher-level protocols**.
