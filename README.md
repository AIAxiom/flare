# FLARE (Fast Local App Relay & Exchange)

FLARE is a high-performance, local inter-application communication protocol built on UDP. It aims to provide a fast and secure way for applications to exchange data efficiently within a local environment.

## Features (Planned)
- TBD

## Pre-Coding Tasks
### üìå Research & Design
- [ ] Define protocol architecture (message structure, headers, state management).
- [ ] Decide on TCP/UDP hybrid usage strategy.
- [ ] Choose an encryption method for secure communication.
- [ ] Determine authentication and handshake mechanisms.
- [ ] Identify potential optimizations for low-latency performance.
- [ ] Create initial API design and function signatures.

### ‚ö° Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize GitHub repository (`FLARE`).
- [ ] Set up project directory structure.
- [ ] Define project dependencies (e.g., cryptography, networking libraries).
- [ ] Configure development environment and CI/CD workflows.
- [ ] Write an initial contribution guide and code style guidelines.

### üèó Core Development
- [ ] Implement basic socket communication (TCP/UDP binding, listening, sending).
- [ ] Develop message serialization/deserialization logic.
- [ ] Implement connection management (sessions, state tracking).
- [ ] Add encryption layer for secure messaging.
- [ ] Implement authentication and identity verification.
- [ ] Design and implement an event-driven system for handling messages.
- [ ] Optimize performance (buffering, threading, congestion control).

### üîç Testing & Validation
- [ ] Write unit tests for core functionalities.
- [ ] Develop benchmark tests for performance analysis.
- [ ] Simulate real-world use cases and stress test under load.
- [ ] Debug networking issues and optimize data transfer efficiency.

### üìñ Documentation & Examples
- [ ] Create API documentation.
- [ ] Write example implementations for different use cases.
- [ ] Set up a basic tutorial for getting started with FLARE.
- [ ] Draft security considerations and best practices.

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Implement QUIC-based transport layer for even lower latency.
- [ ] Add multi-tenant support with user isolation.
- [ ] Develop monitoring and logging tools for debugging.
- [ ] Extend protocol to support WebSocket-based communication.
